# Genomic Architecture and Introgression Shape a Butterfly Radiation

This repository contains the scripts used in Edelman *et al* 2019, "Genomic Architecture and Introgression Shape a Butterfly Radiation"

In many sub-directories, there is a `runAll.sh` file, which contains a master script that gathers necessary data and runs the relevant analysis. In some cases,such as in the heading "windowDefinitions", we used several iterations in the paper but include a single example, in this case *erato* clade 10 kb abutting windows. To re-create any other class of window (different reference genome, window size, or distance between windows), one can simply adjust the parameters in `runAll.sh`.

Any scripts used in the relevant directory can be found in the respective `code` subdirectory. Data for this project is stored in Dryad, https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.b7bj832

Any inquiries can be directed to Nate Edelman, at nedelman@g.harvard.edu
